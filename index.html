        <h1>Hood Mapping</h1>
        <p>Neighborhoods are unnecessarily vague. This project seeks to “ground” them by locating, mapping and then naming them — wherever they might exist. It builds on the excellent work being done in the area of <a href="http://urbanism.uchicago.edu/page/crowd-sourced-neighborhoods">crowd-sourced neighborhood</a> mapping, focusing especially on making them "real" by proposing names, boundaries, centers, and a means of engagement.</p>

<p>The Chicago neighborhood draw tool will allow student urbanists to draw Chicago's neighborhoods and collect stories about the people who live there. Residents will have the opportunity to see the results and participate with shared contributions and comments. Photos, video, and narratives about the neighborhoods will be accessed through a map highlighting the different neighborhoods. Other important boundaries will be included on the interactive map, such as neighborhood associations and district maps. </p>
